## What we planned
- Define scope and select baseline models (SDXL, ControlNet, AnimateDiff).
- Create public GitHub repo and email professor link.
- Draft README and file structure.
- Collect sample FAU Engineering images for reference.

## What we did
- Created GitHub repo and cloned it locally.
- Built initial folders and documentation.
- Added requirements and environment files.
- Downloaded one FAU Engineering image for `results/frame_000.png`.

## Obstacles / Decisions
- GPU availability for full runs (Colab vs local).
- Model version choice (SDXL gives better quality for T2I).

## Next steps (Week 2)
- Implement `generate_frames.py` to produce 5–10 frames.
- Add `frames_to_video.py` to assemble frames.
- Test mini pipeline and save demo.mp4 in `results/`.
