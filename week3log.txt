# Week 3 Log — Text2Image + Image2Image Video Generation for FAU Engineering
Date: November 21, 2025
Team: Akhileshwar Reddy Bommineni, Manaswini Pasupuleti, Pathri Jaydeep
Professor: Velibor Adzic

## What we planned
- Begin implementing the ONNX Text2Image pipeline.
- Ensure the pipeline is portable and runs on any device.
- Generate demonstration frames for Week 3 progress.

## What we did
- Created a mock ONNX Stable Diffusion pipeline that generates placeholder frames.
- Ensured the code runs on Mac, Windows, Linux, Python 3.10–3.12 without extra downloads.
- Added saved frames in results/week3_frames/.
- Cleaned repository to remove corrupted ONNX binaries and MacOS metadata.
- Ensured full reproducibility for professor grading.

## Obstacles
- Real ONNX models required authentication or failed to download.
- Python 3.12 broke diffusers + torch compatibility.
- ONNX model binaries became corrupted due to login redirects.
- Resolved by switching to mock pipeline for academic demonstration.

## Next steps (Week 4)
- Implement image2image refinement (mock or lightweight).
- Combine multiple frames into a smooth video.
- Prepare final demo video for FAU Engineering branding.
